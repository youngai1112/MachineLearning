PST\\n\\t     \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Folks, we're about to start the BACKGROUND BRIEFING \\non the aid package.\\n\\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \\nPresident -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \\nyesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \\nand political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \\n\\n\\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \\nbasic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \\nFirst, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \\nwith available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \\nhave been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \\nno need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \\nany of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \\nare available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \\ntomorrow.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \\nsupport Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \\nare directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \\nbeen worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \\ndeliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \\nto maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \\nwanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \\nfeel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \\nfront of you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \\ntrade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \\ncapital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \\nwell into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \\ngovernments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \\nso.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \\ntrade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \\ncommission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \\nVice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \\nChernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \\nthe barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \\na vastly expanded relationship.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \\nthe first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \\ngive you some general background on what these programs are.  \\nI'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \\nand medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \\nbeen underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \\ngrant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \\nthere's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \\nmajor cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \\nfor Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \\nbe continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \\npharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \\nknow, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \\nwith Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \\nthat we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \\nFood for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \\nThe value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \\nconcessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \\nbut I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \\nprincipal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \\nthereafter for the life of the deal.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \\nsupport.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \\ngoing to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \\nis the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \\nAnd so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \\nenterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \\ngoal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \\nRussia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President has also decided to create a \\nprivatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \\ngovernment in its priority objective of trying to convert state \\nenterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \\nalso agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \\nEurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \\nprominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \\npage is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \\nthis administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \\npursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \\nof $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \\ntables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \\nlaunching.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The President is also calling for the development of \\na democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \\ntry to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \\nefforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \\nRussia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \\nresettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \\nconceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \\nproject.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \\nto help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \\nstates and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \\nmake sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \\nwith Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \\nconstruction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \\nbasis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \\nvery closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \\nthat we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \\nare two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \\ninitial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \\npossibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \\ngas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \\nthe oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \\nenvironmental damage.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \\nabout the new group being created that the Vice President will \\nchair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \\nwith Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \\ncommittee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \\nto break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \\ntrade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \\ninvestment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \\nproblem full-time.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \\ninvestment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \\nanalogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \\njust thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \\ncommitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \\nsenior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \\nimportant.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \\nsupport Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \\nstatus.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \\nour advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \\nlong-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \\nparamount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \\nsupporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \\ntheir access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     You'll note that Ex-Im has extended $82 million in \\ncredit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \\n$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \\nproject.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \\nagreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \\nframework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \\nRussian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \\nWe think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \\nget there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \\nconference, the G-7 conference.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \\ndefer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \\nobjectives with you.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \\nunfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \\nin Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \\nsecure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \\nunder the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \\nRecently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \\nagreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \\nto three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \\nmillion for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \\nprogram.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \\nbomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \\nthe construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \\nfrom the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \\ncontribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \\nconstruction of that storage facility.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And finally, a $10-million tranche of money to help \\nin the establishment of a monitoring system for the nuclear \\nmaterials as they are withdrawn from the weapons system.  So we \\nadd that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \\nwhich has been flowing -- about $150 million for some overall \\nsafety improvements for various kinds of equipment and safety \\nmeasures that we have been working out with the Russians over the \\nlast couple of years.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \\nwork with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \\nand Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \\ncouple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \\nsafety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \\nterritory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \\nSTART I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \\nthe Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \\nthem.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \\nas a very important step in that process.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The OPIC funds to -- is that for the field in \\nKazhakstan -- and Conoco already signed this deal with \\nKazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \\nsame one, why do you feel it's necessary?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \\ndeal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \\nfield.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \\noil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \\ntoday.  So it's completely new.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \\nother American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \\ntwo things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \\nSiberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \\noil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \\nThe objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \\nnatural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \\nwill, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \\nRussia needs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \\nfor Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \\nAmerican company.  And the American government has played a \\nleading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \\nin OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \\nthat are already there?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  On that point, should other American companies \\nexpect to get administration support for such deals, or should \\nthey now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \\nbillion?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \\nEx-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \\nU.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \\nand the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \\nthink it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \\nthere will be $2 billion in financing available for American \\ncompanies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \\ndeals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \\nsupport for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \\ntremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \\ncompanies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \\ngas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \\nsoak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \\neven extend beyond that.  And if so, the government will respond.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \\n$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \\ncurrent year budget costs --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \\nyou to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \\ncurrent year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \\nwhich the payments are due?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \\nfood sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \\nUSDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \\nexpend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \\nrefer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \\ngoing to be involved in that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \\nwith the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \\ncoming into office that there were literally thousands of \\norganization, private organizations in the United States that in \\none way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \\ndemocratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \\nAnd there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \\nhad a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \\nadministration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \\nto draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \\nsome coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \\nefforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \\nsoon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \\nthe former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \\nuse this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \\nour own government, but the resources of the American private \\nsector and schools and communities across the nation.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \\nyet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \\nbesides the $300 million the President talked about?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \\nis requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \\nthe President has done this weekend is to consult really \\nintensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \\nmeasures the United States could take in some of these areas to \\nsupport reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \\nreturns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \\nally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \\nagricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \\nconsensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \\nSo why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \\nexplain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \\nfor food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \\ninto that situation?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \\nUnited States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \\nand food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \\nbetween 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \\nhere -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \\nto ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \\nlast year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \\nthat program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \\ntherefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \\nprogram.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \\nother officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \\ncould promote American grain sales.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \\nannounced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \\nFood for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \\nauthority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \\nfor a concessional loan program.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \\nshort-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \\na long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \\nthis program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \\nworked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \\nprincipal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \\nlife of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \\ninterest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \\nbelieve and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \\nfor them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \\nand put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \\nvery important grain relationship, which is important for them, \\nand it's important for the American farm community.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \\nit explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \\nloan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \\nis that right? \\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \\nabout that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \\nthe Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \\nbecause of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \\nknow about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \\n$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \\ntaken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \\nmarket share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \\nrespond to a specific request from the Russian government for \\nmajor food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \\ngrant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \\nwe looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \\ngreat effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \\nthe Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \\nthem with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \\nthe short-term payments.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \\nFood for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \\nauthority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \\nnot need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \\nto make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \\nthe $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \\nallocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \\ncan begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \\nimportant in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \\nthat we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \\nable to do so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \\nmillion -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \\nhave a range from 0 to --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \\nfor it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \\nthat's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \\nharvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \\nshipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \\nharvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \\nsame level of food imports from the West.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \\nconsiderable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \\nrepublics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \\nHave you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \\nthe same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \\nsome of the other republics?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \\nconscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \\nAmerican support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \\nUnion.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \\narea of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \\nyou see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \\nroughly 50 percent to the other countries. \\n\\t     \\n\\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \\nUkraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \\nwill continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \\nsummit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \\nother countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \\nproductive and they're hard-hitting.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \\nAmerican energy companies and other companies to believe that \\nRussia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \\ntaxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \\nprimary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \\nonly the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \\nlike to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \\nconvinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \\nsupport Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \\nWestern governments have the financial resources over the next \\ndecade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \\nsector can do that.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \\ncapability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \\ngood match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \\ninvestment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \\ntechnology and new capital to finance new production.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \\nwants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \\non it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \\nthe first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \\nlast night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \\nClinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \\nsignal to the American business community that we support their \\nefforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\\nIm and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \\nsupport them.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \\ndeliver on making Russia a more --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \\nwould note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \\nChernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \\nsector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \\nPresident, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \\nbarriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \\nand gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \\ncommittee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \\nthe work.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \\nadminister the private sector portion of the program?  And will \\nthe U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \\nthe actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \\nRussian government for distribution at their will?\\n\\t     \\t    \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \\nabout the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \\nprogram itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \\nthrough American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \\nthat the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \\nthe intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \\nCongress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \\naccount for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \\nmonths intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \\nthese programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \\nthe area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \\nis carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \\nthe food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \\nthrough Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \\nhousing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \\nwe'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \\ndemocratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \\nprivate individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \\njournalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \\nnoticed.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \\nactivities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \\ncarried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \\nRussian government, some with Russian citizens.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \\non the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \\nPresident has to do on that?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \\nnoted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \\nthe relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \\nfair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \\nreturn to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \\nwe'll get back to the Russian government.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \\nyou got here?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \\nfor these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \\nprepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\\nlet me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \\nconsultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \\nthe American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \\nconcerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \\nwe take any action.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \\nhave to go to Congress for anything at this point?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \\nbeginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \\nthe funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \\nSo the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \\nseek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \\neffect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \\nagencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \\nthat's the advantage of this particular initiative.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \\nlong-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \\nheading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \\nCongress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \\nprepared to go to Congress for various things?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \\nclear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \\nPresident Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \\nfunding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \\nmajor congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \\nRepresentative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \\ndelegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \\nAnd we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \\nit stands now.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \\nthese items represent different or new ways of spending the money \\nalready appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \\nitems represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \\nthat it was not previously set to be?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \\nsaid that these are all projects that either Congress had \\nallocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \\nsome funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \\nadministration took office and had some new ideas about how the \\nfunds might be expended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \\nthe FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\\nEx-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \\nfurther our programs.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \\nconcessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \\nfunding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \\nlooked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \\nmarket share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \\nfound it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \\nfor this Russian officer resettlement --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's from the \\nFreedom Support Act funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In other words, all of the money is being \\ndirectly spent in new ways, so to speak --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Most of the grant \\nprojects that you see -- if you look at the general chart, the \\nsecond chart, it's broken down into grant and credits.  And if \\nyou look under grants, the technical cooperation projects that \\ntotal $281.9 million -- that is almost all Freedom Support Act \\nfunding.  A little bit of it is leftover funds from fiscal year \\n'92.  The Nunn-Lugar funds, of course, you know about the \\nlegislative history of those funds.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     cooperation --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  From FY '92?  I \\ndon't have the exact figure.  It was not a considerable figure.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Could you tell us please, has anything happened \\nhere this weekend that will break the log jam between Ukraine and \\nRussia over START -- for START I and II as a result of what's \\nhappened here --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Both presidents, \\nPresident Yeltsin and President Clinton, will be discussing this \\nissue this morning.  In fact, we haven't yet gotten to security \\nand arms control related issues.  That will be this morning's \\nsession.  I know that President Clinton will be very strongly \\nreinforcing that this is a top priority for us.  We've been \\ntalking to the Russians and the Ukrainians over the last couple \\nof weeks about ways that we might help to facilitate the \\ndiscussions between them.  Up to this point, this has been a very \\nimportant negotiation that's been going on essentially between \\nMoscow and Kiev.  And we are at the point now of essentially \\ndiscussing with them if there are ways that we could contribute \\nto this discussion, help to move things forward essentially.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But in terms of what is coming out of this weekend, \\nI don't yet know.  In a couple hours we'll know.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q?\\t    Just a follow-up on the financing here.  Is \\nany of this robbing Peter to pay Boris -- since it's all current \\nyear appropriations, have you taken it from anyplace that's been \\nearmarked and put it into this fund?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There are smoke and \\nmirrors here, and I think it's an important point to note.  We \\ncould have given you a page of assistance numbers that included \\nout-year funding.  We're going to make a long-term commitment to \\nmany of these projects -- for instance, the enterprise funds, the \\nprivatization effort, the housing effort.  And we've already \\ntalked to the Russians about our long-term commitment.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     We could have put in really big numbers and this \\ncould have been a bigger package, but we wanted to make a point:  \\nThis package is FY '93.  It's funds that we have.  And we're \\ngoing to do what we say we're going to do.  And the President \\nfeels very strongly about that.  In the past there is a legacy \\nthat the western governments, the combination of governments, put \\nup large budget figures and for any number of reasons we're not \\nable to meet them, we're determined, and the President is \\ndetermined, to carry out every single program in this package.  \\nAnd we'll do it.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we do have a longer-term commitment, and that's \\npart of the discussions on economics this weekend.  We're looking \\nfor Russian ideas on what it is we can do to most effectively \\nsupport reform.  And we've told them that we do have a commitment \\non some of these programs beyond this fiscal year.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     taken it way from any --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, we haven't.  \\nOkay, the question is, have we reprogrammed any of these funds; \\nso have we taken it from other countries to pay for programs in \\nRussia?  The answer is no, we have not done so.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  In terms of funding, there is no available \\nmonies left -- and you simply find a creative way to find money \\nsomewhere else.  Doesn't that, in fact, support the -- theory?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Not at all.  I \\ndon't think it does.  That's a particular example, and the \\nexample is grain sales.  The Commodity Credit Corporation credit \\nguarantee program was short-term loans that Russia had to pay \\nback within 12 to 15 months.  You all know about Russia's debt \\nproblem, and Russia was unable to meet those commitments.  So we \\nlooked for a way to do two things:  to meet Russia's requirement \\nfor grain.  They're a net grain importer on a massive scale, and \\nalso meet our objective of making sure that the American farmers \\nhave a chance to sell their products to Russia.  And we simply \\nlook for another way to finance that.  And we have legislative \\nauthority to do it.  This program has been successful in other \\nareas.  We had not tried it before in the former Soviet Union, \\nbut we thought we should now.\\n\\t     \\t  \\n\\t     Q\\t  Isn't this really the Bush-Clinton aid package \\nfor Russia, since these funds were really first derived by \\ninitiatives put forward by President Bush?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I don't think \\nthat's a fair characterization.  A lot of these funds were \\nappropriated by the U.S. Congress is 1991, in 1992.  This \\nadministration took office and inherited some obligations that \\nthe Bush administration had made.  But we had a long six to seven \\nweek review of this program.  We decided to meet the commitments \\nthat had been made by the previous administration.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But we have gone well beyond them in funding the \\nenterprise fund, which was just an idea, but the idea had not \\nbeen filled out with a program.  There was no number attached to \\nit.  In grouping together some projects and trying to make them \\ninto a coherent whole in the privatization effort, I would say, \\nis another Clinton initiative.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     Further, we listened to the Russian government and \\nlistened to the Russian military who told us that the \\nresettlement of their officers was important to them for \\npolitical and economic and social reasons.  And President Clinton \\nhas responded to that.  And we are making a long-term commitment \\nthat beyond this demonstration project we're going to figure out \\na way to do much more in trying to settle those officers.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would also say that the President has given \\nimpetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \\nabout what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \\nhave some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \\nitself to the Russian experience.  And in calling for the \\ncreation of a democracy corps, which is another new initiative, \\nwe're hopeful that we can take the resources of the private \\nsector as well as the American government, to achieve that \\nobjective.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     So I would not characterize it that way at all.  And \\nas most of you know, I am a career civil servant.  I was in the \\nlast administration.  I'm very familiar with what the last \\nadministration did.  And I would characterize this as a Clinton \\nassistance package for Russia.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's been a lot of criticism that aid in the \\npast has not gotten to the people.  Is there anything in this \\noutside of the ombudsman, that will guarantee that this money \\nwill not just disappear because it's being administered by the \\nRussian government?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that -- I \\nknow that the President and other senior officials of our \\ngovernment are concerned that American money be spent wisely and \\nthat it get to the source that it's intended -- for which it's \\nintended.  And so we're going to take great care -- AID and the \\nState Department will take great care in making sure that the \\nfunds are expended properly and that they're reaching their \\nsource.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     I would not that this package is not simply a \\npackage of support solely to the Russian government.  Some of \\nthese projects, especially in democratization and exchanges, are \\ngoing to be worked out directly with Russian private individuals, \\nwith businesses.  The private enterprise support is another \\nexample of that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If I could just add \\na word on this point with regard to the SSD-related programs, one \\narea that we've been looking at very, very closely is \\nconsideration of actually using Russian firms in subcontracting \\nfor these kinds of programs.  They would be working very closely, \\nof course, with the American firms, who would be the prime \\ncontractors.  But this is a fine example, I think, of a more --of \\na imaginative and flexible approach toward getting some of that \\nfunding down to the grassroots level, down to the ground in \\nRussia; but at the same time ensuring that it is spent \\nefficiently and for the purposes for which it was intended.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  When would the democracy corps start?  Exactly \\nwhen do you see this happening?  How would get it off the ground?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \\nis today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \\nit's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \\nthe next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \\non May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \\nthe last couple of weeks the administration has begun to reach \\nout to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \\nto help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \\nthat we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \\nin a much more effective way the activities of our own \\ngovernment.  We do have 10 or 15 agencies that are active in \\nRussia in one way or another.  We think it makes sense to draw \\nthem together and to focus their efforts.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Excuse me.  How much of this $1.6 billion will \\nactually be spent in the United States by American made goods?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't have any \\nfigures for you now, but perhaps we could try to work something \\nup in the next couple of days on that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  This figure is larger than the figure that has \\nbeen in the press -- did this program grow yesterday as a result \\nof the discussions, or have we just been that far off the mark?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\\nunfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \\nI'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \\nus to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \\nbriefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \\nintellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \\nthe ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \\nhad this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \\nbeen refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \\ngoing over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \\nWashington and the government in Moscow through our own embassy.  \\nAnd so it's been evolving.  But this particular package has been \\ntogether for about two weeks.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Where is Yeltsin's input into this then?  There \\nwas so much talk before about the President wanted to get \\nYeltsin's views about specifically what was needed and so forth.  \\nIs that in the out years?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, it's both.  \\nPresident Yeltsin has on several occasions told us, for instance, \\nthat support for the creation of private businesses is important \\nto him; that the resettlement of Russian military officers is \\nimportant; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \\nthe state industries is important to them.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     And so what we did was to try to make those the \\ncenterpiece of our technical assistance part o the package.  We \\nlistened to him.  On the privatization effort, we have been \\nworking with the Russian government for months on this trying to \\nwork out all the details.  So the Russian government on most of \\nthese programs was involved every step of the way.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     But let me get at the other part of your question.  \\nThe President is also using this weekend to talk about a broader \\nset of initiatives that we might undertake.  And we're looking \\nfor his ideas.  The President has brought his own ideas to the \\ntable -- for instance, on energy and the environment and in \\nhousing.  But we're looking for Russian ideas not.  We need to \\nconsult with the Congress; and we need to consult with the other \\nallied governments that are also active.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  There's essentially nothing that happened in \\nthe last day and a half that measurably altered the package that \\nyou came in with?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  This particular \\npackage, as I said, was worked out and was ready about two weeks \\nago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \\nthe final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \\nprimarily talked about future, about what more the United States \\nand other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \\nwhich is our base objective here.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \\nto train bankers and businessmen and officers.  Can you tell me \\nwhat about job training for workers who are displaced by \\nprivatization?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \\nhave a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \\nfinancial services in the United States.  Part of the housing \\ninitiative, it's not just to build housing units, it's to retrain \\nRussian officers who are retiring into other professions.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     money for job training for workers whose \\njobs are disappearing because of privatization --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We have not yet \\nallocated any money for that.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Why not?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million is going to build 450 \\nhousing units.  Isn't that a lot of money per unit given what the \\nWestern dollar will buy in the former Soviet Union?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  If you want to do \\nhousing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \\nof a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \\ngot to think about the purchase of land.  You've got to think \\nabout sewage and gas and electricity and so forth.  And it's also \\nretraining.  It's not enough to put retired -- an officer coming \\nout of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \\nWe think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \\nas well.  This is responding to a request from the Russian \\ngovernment.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     of the $6 million will go to retrain --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Are you talking about apartment buildings or \\nsingle --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We're talking about \\nsingle, individual dwellings.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  You're saying that only 450 families will be \\nserved by this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  What I want to -- I \\nthought I pointed out earlier, this is a demonstration project.  \\nWhat we didn't want to do -- given the experience that the \\nGermans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \\nhousing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \\na huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \\ncouple of months and try to figure out with American \\norganizations in the private sector the best way to get this job \\ndone.  \\n\\t     \\n\\t     I noted that we have a long-term commitment to that.  \\nAnd so I would expect that we would put a lot more money into \\nthis in the future .  But we want to do it wisely; we want to \\nspend the money wisely.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  What is it about this program that convinces \\nyou that it will protect Russia's reforms and that Russia will be \\nin a position to may back the money they're supposed to pay back, \\nespecially considering their other debt problem?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \\nit's important to note that the United States on its own does not \\nhave the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \\nIt's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \\nour allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \\nthe Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \\ncan simply play a role, and we feel we have an obligation to do \\nso, which is consistent with our national interests.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  Did the President say that the value of the \\nU.S. contribution was that it would create security and \\nprosperity for the United States?  So what is it about this \\nprogram that does this?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think you have to \\ngo back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \\nand that is we want to do everything we can to support the \\ncontinuation of reform.  We are convinced that if reformers stay \\nin power, then we'll be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear \\nforces, foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction, \\nwhich are the three benefits to the United States from reform in \\nRussia.  So it's not a simple question.  You can't just say that \\nthis program is the answer.  It's a long-term question and we \\nhave to make a long-term commitment to it.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t  And then on the question of Russia's ability to \\nrepay, what convinces you they'll be able to pay seven to 15 \\nyears from now?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the Russian \\ngovernment has made a commitment to repay, and what we're hoping \\nis that if reform continues, and if they can continue to improve \\ntheir oil and gas sector and earn additional hard currency \\nrevenues, that Russia will be in a position six or seven years \\nfrom now to pay back those loans.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     substantial government-to-government loan \\nwe've ever gotten into with the Russians?\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I don't want to \\nanswer authoritatively on that.  I don't go back 20 or 30 years \\non this.  But in the last four or five years, yes it is, because \\nthe previous way that we financed grain exports was really to \\njust ensure private bank loans.  This is a different type of \\neffort.\\n\\t     \\n\\t     Q\\t     government loans in any other sector that \\nyou recall?  I know it wasn't done in --\\n\\t     \\n\\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's fair \\nto say this is a new and unique effort.\\n\\n                               END10:25 A.M.

Now to say\\n> that H is as consistent with the data as HG is to say P(x | H) =  P(x | HG).\\n> Can you elaborate some on this.\\n\\nWell, \"P(x | A) = P(x | B)\" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\\n\\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\\n\\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\\n\\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\\n\\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\\ndoesn\\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\\n\\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\\'t know\\nthe actual values, and it\\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\\nthrow out any such HG.\\n\\n> Also, in the \"real world\" it isn\\'t as clear cut and dry it seems \\n> to me. We can\\'t always determine whether the equality \"P(x | H) =  \\n> P(x | HG)\" is true. \\n\\nThat\\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\\nnot a `divine component\\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\\'.\\n\\nNow it seems to me, as I\\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious\\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component\\' in addition, since I would\\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\\'t\\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\\nG is `divine component\\', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\\n\\n> BTW, my beef with your Baysian argument was not a mathematical one - \\n> I checked most of your work and didn\\'t find an error and you seem very  \\n> careful so there probably isn\\'t a \"math mistake\".

I\\'m not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of \\n> statistician), so this would be very helpful. \\n\\nNot that I\\'m a statistician as such either, but:\\n\\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\\nthe (read `my\\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\\nmeasurable ways.\\n\\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \\nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\\n\\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\\n\\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\\'t* an\\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\\n\\nSorry if that\\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\\'s rather difficult to\\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\\narea under them is always unity.\\n\\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I\\'ve\\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\\n\\nThen\\n\\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\\n\\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\\n\\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\\ndon\\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\\nof heads.\\n\\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\\nmodified according to\\n\\n                            P(H | A)\\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nand\\n\\n                            P(H | B)\\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nNow we don\\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\\n\\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\\n\\n                 n\\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\\n\\nand\\n                    n\\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\\n\\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\\n\\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\\nis the same.\\n\\n>> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them \\n>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases\\n>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>> the notional estimated probability that they don\\'t exist, \\n\\n> It\\'s important to draw a distinction between theism that could\\n> be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can\\'t.\\n> Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible,\\n> it doesn\\'t make sense to say \"lack of evidence\" supports the contrary \\n> view.\\n\\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\\nin terms of our Ockham\\'s Razor discussion, and I\\'d bin it on those grounds.\\n\\n> So it depends upon your conception of this god.

And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \\nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \\n\\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\\nIt\\'s my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\\nsuper-survival. \\n\\n \\n>and it\\'s a lot worse than Heaven.  That\\'s the only comparison that matters.\\n\\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \\nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \\n\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\" asked an\\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\\nto the effect of, \"Well what good is your Heaven if there\\'s no hunting?\\nScram.\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \\nimmortality). \\n\\n\\n>Alan Terlep\\t\\t\\t\\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\\n>Oakland University, Rochester, MI\\t\\t\\t\\n>atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\\t\\t\\t\\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\\n>Rushing in where angels fear to tread.\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n   Pax,\\n\\n    Dana\\n',\n",

You refer to\\n# differing interpretations of \"create,\" and say that many Christians may\\n# not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith\\n# on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is\\n# truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.\\n\\nIt may be \"irrelevant\" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say\\n\"bias\"?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You\\'re right, \"the\\nbottom line IS truth,\" independant from you or anyone else.  Since you\\nproclaim \"truths\" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what\\nauthority you do this?  Because \"it says so in the Bible?\"  --Does the\\nBible \"say so,\" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a\\nscripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or \"disapproval\"?\\n\\nExcuse moi, but your line of \"truths\" haven\\'t moved me one bit to persuade\\nme that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the \"preachers\" of \"truth\" on\\nthis net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking\\ncrew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...\\nBTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus\\nto the pharisees: \"ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,\\nbut your hearts are far removed from me...\"\\n\\n# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created\\n# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say \"granted the Mormon\\n# belief...\" You can\\'t grant your conclusion and then expect the point to\\n# have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address\\n# and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the\\n# conclusion that you grant.\\n\\nSophistry.  Look who\\'s talking: \"jumping to conclusions?\"  You wouldn\\'t do\\nthat yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless\\nwhether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points\\nof view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration\\nwhatsoever.\\n\\n#\\n# The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus\\n# is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS\\n# belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.\\n\\nA beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation\\nof lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you.\\nJesus and lucifer are not \"the same,\" silly, and you know it.\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n# The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is\\n# nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible\\n# says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:\\n\\nCorrection: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible\\nindeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they\\n\"belong to\" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have\\nrebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\"\\nbut it doesn\\'t mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to\\nseparate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of\\nsalvation.\\n\\n#\\n#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the\\n#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\";\\n#        (Matthew 13:38)\\n\\nSo?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the\\nkingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus\\n(and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the\\nwicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue\\nof satan\\'s spirit-origin (and of those who followed him) has not been\\naddressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us\\nabout \"the only true God,\" whom you interpret according to your own likes\\nand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about\\nHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\\nway or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission\\nand progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob\\nor opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited\\nevery continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.\\n\\n#  This is really a red herring. It doesn\\'t address any issue raised, but\\n#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read\\n#  something into the Bible, doesn\\'t change what the Bible teaches.\\n\\nSigh.  \"What the Bible teaches\"?  Or: \"what the bible teaches according to\\nRobert Weiss and co.?\"  I respect the former, I reject the latter without\\nthe remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by\\nthe way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you\\nbeing a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a\\nChristian (following my own image of Him in my heart).\\n\\n(...)\\n\\n#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of\\n#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were \\'official doctrine.\\' I don\\'t\\n#  think that it matters if McConkie\\'s views were canon. That is not the\\n#  issue.  Were McConkie\\'s writings indicative of Mormon belief on this\\n#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may\\n#  certainly be.\\n\\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\\nis obviously very important.  McConkie\\'s views have been controversial\\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\\nas \"McConkie\\'s Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\\'s books!\\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

Thus,\\nin an age when the Christian Europe itself shed Christian blood and when \\npeople in Europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs\\ndiffered from theirs, the Ottoman Empire became the sole country where the\\ninquisition did not exist, where deaths at the stake were unheard of and \\nwhere accusations of witchcraft were not made. And the barbarian (!) Turkey\\nwas the only country where the Jews persecuted and chased away everywhere\\nby the Christians, could find asylum. These facts demonstrate that Muslim\\ncountries provided spiritually far better living conditions than Christian\\ncountries.\"[1]\\n\\n\"The Turks, who are a conquering nation, did not Turkify the nations that came\\nunder their rule; instead, they respected their religions and traditions. It\\nwas a stroke of luck for Romania to live under Turkish rule instead of\\nRussian or Austrian rule. Because otherwise there would not have been a\\nRomanian nation today\" (Popescu Ciocanel).\\n\\n\"Turks rule over people under their administration only externally, without\\ninterfering with their internal structures. On account of this, the autonomy\\nof minorities in Turkey is better and more complete than any in the most\\nadvanced European countries.\"[2]\\n\\n\"...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. This flaw\\nis older than Islam and Christianity. But there has never been any examples\\nof this adjuration in Turkey because Turks never oppress anybody on account\\nof his religion. If enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of\\nsimple contempt among us too, or if it did not keep translating itself into\\naction, many nations in our Europe would probably have considered themselves\\nhappy!\" (A. de Mortraye).[3]\\n\\n\"Turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the\\ninquisition. On the contrary, it served as an asylum for the unfortunate\\nvictims of Christian fanaticism. If you look into history, you will see that\\nin the fifteenth century thousands of Jews who were expelled from Spain and\\nPortugal found such a good asylum in Turkey that their descendants have been\\nliving there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years,\\nand are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the\\ncruelty of Christians, especially that of the Orthodoxes. No Jew is able to\\nappear in public during Easter celebrations in Athens, even today. In Turkey,\\nhowever, if the Israelites are insulted by the Greek and Armenian communities,\\nlocal courts immediately take them under their protection.\"\\n\\n\"In that vast and calm country of the sultan, all religions and nations are\\nliving together peacefully. Although the mosque is superior to the church and\\nthe synagogue, it does not replace them. Because of this, the Catholic sect is\\nmore free in Istanbul and Smyrna compared with Paris and Lyon. In addition \\nto the fact that no law in Turkey prohibits the open-air ceremonies of this \\nsect, neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. While the\\ndead are being taken to the graves, a long line of priests bear processional\\ncandles and chant Catholic hymns. When all the priests in all the churches in\\nthe Galata and Beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical\\nprocessions during the Eucharist celebrations, chanting hymns and bearing\\ntheir crosses and religious banners, a detachment of soldiers escorts them\\nwhich forces even the Turks to stand in respect around the group of \\npriests.\" (A.

If the image of fire is often used in this\\nconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.\\n     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as\\nsomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as\\nany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --\\nbut the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS\\nSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with\\nmatches).\\n     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word \"Gehenna,\"\\none of the words translated \"Hell\" in the New Testament. It refers\\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\\nto Molech.

To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.  \\n\\nJoe Fisher\\n \\n',\n",

Him you must see.\\'\\n \"We were under those trees by the mosque, in an open space....\\n \\'I don\\'t believe you,\" I said, but followed to a nail-studded door.

Rags strewed the mud floor around an \\n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \\n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \\n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man\\'s body lying face \\n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \\n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \\n as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.\\'\\n\\n \"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \\n Dro\\'s. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\\n so long and furiously I\\'d never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \\n laughter, quick and simple as child\\'s. Both were a cover for his sense\\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\\n Christian massacring \\'infidels\\' was more horrible than the reverse would\\n have been.\\n\\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel\\'s chattels, the last \\n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \\n looms, even spinning-wheels.\\n\\n \\'Thank you for a lot, Dro,\\' I said to him back in camp. \\'But now I must \\n leave.\\'...We shook hands, the captain said \\'A bientot, mon camarade.\\' And \\n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \\n Like Lot\\'s wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \\n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.\\'\"\\n\\np. 354.\\n\\n\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\\n high region called the Karabakh.

A campaign shaped; more raids on\\n Moslem villages.\"\\n\\np. 358.\\n\\n\"It will be three hours to take,\" Dro told me. We\\'d close in on three\\n sides.\\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\\n\"But the women and children?\"\\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\\n\\np. 360.\\n\\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \\n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. \\'Djul lies under that,\\' said \\n Dro, pointing. \\'Our men also attack from the other sides.\\'\\n\\n Then, \\'Whee-ee!\\' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \\n I heard our Utica brass roar.\\n\\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\\n The came a shrill wailing.\\n\\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\\n\\n \\'Tartarski!\\' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women\\'s cries.\\n\\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \\n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\\n through alders, on smoldering houses.

Please don\\'t talk about Jesus\\' \"parents\"--the doctrinal positions\\n\\t\\tof the church an unequivocally different regarding Mary and\\n\\t\\tJoseph.  I (personally) have never heard of anything being\\n\\t\\tattributed to St. Joseph other than his sainthood; that is,\\n\\t\\tno reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven,\\n\\t\\timmaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to\\n\\t\\tMary.\\n\\n\\t2.  I would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our\\n\\t\\tdoctrines about Mary.  Needless to say, that presents a \\n\\t\\tsignificant problem to those who accept the bible as the only\\n\\t\\tsource of doctrine.  If, however, one turns to the sacred \\n\\t\\ttraditions of the undivided Christian Church, there is no\\n\\t\\tproblem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a\\n\\t\\tunanimous belief among the apostles and all the early \\n\\t\\tgeneration that Mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,\\n\\t\\tetc. etc.  It wasn\\'t until the reformation that these doctrines\\n\\t\\twere called into question.  As far as I am concerned (again, my\\n\\t\\tpersonaly feelings) if it\\'s a choice between the apostles or\\n\\t\\tLuther, I\\'ll choose the apostles every time, whether or not\\n\\t\\tit is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men\\n\\t\\thave determined to be \"the bible\".\\n\\n\\tLike a said, just a couple of notes.  As is often said, I believe that\\nwe must agree to (politely) disagree.  \\n\\tMay God\\'s peace and blessings be with you always in your search to\\ndiscover His absolute truth.  \\n\\t\\t\\t- Mike Walker\\n\\t\\t\\t  mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t\\t  (Univ. of Illinois)\\n',\n",

As you will\\nno doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:\\n\\nDC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping\\ndevelopment costs low and flying incremental \"X-plane\" hardware.\\nIt\\'s been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they\\'ve built a\\ncomplex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would\\nhave been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s\\nAmerica, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or\\nbuilding the DC-Y.\\n\\nI\\'m sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any\\nexpansion of astronautics.  I don\\'t see a realistic  prospect for\\nbeating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If\\nthe DC flops, it\\'ll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and\\nthe Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a\\nprospect too depressing to bear.\\n\\n(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different\\ndirection.  It doesn\\'t lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital\\nlaunch for under ten megabucks.  It\\'s creating its own market for\\nsmall payloads.)\\n\\nI read the magazines and I\\'ve attended the last two IAFs. There are\\nplenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some\\nof them as good as or better than SSTO.

That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary\\n-- \\nGary Coffman KE4ZV          |    You make it,     | gatech!wa4mei!ke4zv!gary\\nDestructive Testing Systems |    we break it.     | uunet!rsiatl!ke4zv!gary\\n534 Shannon Way             |    Guaranteed!      | emory!kd4nc!ke4zv!gary \\nLawrenceville, GA 30244     |                     | \\n',\n",

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTISING\\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\\na 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\\ncoming from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\\'s Bi-centennial.\\n                                                (cont)\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n',\n",

Very good\\nplayers who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who\\nprovide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.\\n\\nAs a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That\\ndoesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians\\nhad at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could\\ndominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate.\\nHe shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been\\nanyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.\\n\\nGregmeister\\n\",\n",

He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar\\nafter signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of\\ncompetence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better\\nhockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only\\nseemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got\\nto make a number of starts in a row.\\n\\n-SG (a real live Hartford Whalers season ticket holder)\\n-steveg@cadkey.com\\n\",\n",

They felt that we would be\\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\\nchange...but I shouldn\\'t have married to person in the first place )\\nand more....\\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\\ncounsel.\\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\\n  This life is \"but dust\".

Congressional\\nRepublicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what\\nthey felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of POTENTIAL \\nprojects prepared by the US Mayors\\' Conference before the stimulus package\\nwas ever proposed.  (The document in question was designed to pressure the\\nWhite House to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted\\nto Congress.  It didn\\'t work.)\\n\\nThe $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close\\nto covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  If it\\nwere passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and\\nat what level.\\n\\nIn the case of Spokane, Wa., Tom Foley\\'s home district, no one ever\\nexpected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the \\nRepublicans\\' examples) FROM THE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE STIMULUS\\nPACKAGE since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total \\namount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus \\npackage for ALL projects.  \\n\\nThe plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction\\nand remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (Yup, there are\\nplaces where that is true.)  The swimming pool improvements were near the\\nbottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  The $3 million\\nor so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing\\npriorities.\\n\\nIf the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects\\nthat will be affected by the lack of funds.  And that is why the Clinton\\nadministration has been publicizing the issue.\\n\\nA final point.  One may or may not like community block grants.  It is\\nworth noting, however, that Congressional Republicans\\' opposition to them\\nis new.  Since the Nixon administration, Republicans have generally \\nsupported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,\\narguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending\\npriorities than \"Washington bureaucrats.\"  \\n\\nIs it clear now?

I\\n>called up the real-estate office making this offer, made it clear that\\n>I was only checking the local market, and asked about that house. Were\\n>the walls, roof and foundation structurally sound? Yes. Were the\\n>plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code? Yes. Did the\\n>air-conditioning system (an absolute necessity in Phoenix) work?  Yes,\\n>again.  Okay, so what was wrong with the house?  Well, it needed lots\\n>of plastering, painting, yard work, and some patching of the roof --\\n>and yes, low-interest repair loans were available.  Okay, sez I. If\\n>that\\'s all that\\'s wrong with it, just why are you selling a 3-bedroom\\n>house for all of $10,000? Well, squirms the agent, it\\'s in kind of a\\n>bad neighborhood. How bad? sez I, remembering some of the neighborhoods\\n>I\\'ve seen in Chicago and Oakland.  Worst in the city, the agent sighs,\\n>and then he told me this amazing story.\\n>\\n>    Every few years, it seems, the big vice-gangs in Los Angeles notice\\n>that there\\'s no gang presence in Phoenix -- which is just a quick\\n>5-hour drive from LA -- and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary\\n>there. Well, a couple years ago, the colonizing force came to this\\n>neighborhood -- it being poor and Spanish, they figured they could move\\n>right in and take over -- bought this house and started operations.\\n>Unfortunately for them, the neighbors not only didn\\'t like this -- they\\n>didn\\'t care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night,\\n>pimps soliciting their kids, dope- deals on the corners in broad\\n>daylight, and so on -- they weren\\'t afraid to do something about it.\\n>The neighbors called the cops (for some reason, the Phoenix police are\\n>remarkably honest, capable, polite and prompt), and the cops promptly\\n>came and swept up all the whores, pimps and pushers off the street and\\n>away to jail. The remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the\\n>fashion they usually use in LA; they got the complainant\\'s name and\\n>address off the court records, and did a drive-by shooting at his\\n>house.  Well, this wasn\\'t Los Angeles. The moment the neighbors heard\\n>the first gunshots fired, they all ran out their front doors with their\\n>own guns -- rifles, shotguns, pistols, everything -- and shot back.\\n>\\n>    The car didn\\'t make it to the end of the block. It coasted to a\\n>stop, riddled with more holes than the famous Bonnie and Clyde getaway\\n>car (which I\\'ve seen; it\\'s on display in a casino in a casino in Las\\n>Vegas).  The gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured, so the car\\n>caught fire. The neighbors waited a good 15 minutes -- making sure\\n>nobody got out of that car -- before they called the fire department to\\n>come put out the fire and tow the wreck away. By that time, the asphalt\\n>under the car had melted and caught fire too, which subsequently left a\\n>large and nasty pot-hole in the street. The city is slow about\\n>repairing small streets, so the hole stayed there providing a traffic\\n>hazard for several months. All this was two years ago, the agent\\n>concluded, and there\\'s been no trouble since, but the house and the\\n>neighborhood still have a bad reputation -- and that\\'s why the house\\n>was so cheap.\\n>\\n>    Hearing this story, I nearly laughed my ass off. I told the agent\\n>that if I had the money at the moment, I\\'d by-god buy the house; this\\n>was _nothing_ compared to bad neighborhoods I\\'d seen here in\\n>California, where drive-by shootings go unchecked by the well-armed\\n>cops, let alone by the unarmed neighbors.

The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n* What is an attack?\\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\\n\\n  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\\n  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\\n  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\\n  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\\n  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\\n  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\\n  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\\n  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\\n  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\\n  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\\n\\n* What is an attack?\\n\\n  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\\n  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\\n  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\\n  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\\n  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\\n\\n  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\\n  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\\n\\n  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\\n  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\\n  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\\n  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\\n  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\\n\\n  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\\n  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\\n  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\\n  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\\n  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\\n  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\\n\\n  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\\n  n = 2, and so on.\\n\\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\\n\\n  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\\n  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\\n  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\\n  is strong!''\\n\\n  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\\n  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\\n  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\\n  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\\n  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\\n  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\\n  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\\n  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\\n  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\\n\\n  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\\n  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\\n  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\\n  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\\n  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\\n\\n  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\\n  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\\n  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\\n  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\\n  \\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\\n\\n  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\\n  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\\n  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\\n  or) of K and P.\\n\\n  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\\n  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\\n  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\\n  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\\n  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\\n  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\\n  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\\n  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\\n  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\\n  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\\n  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\\n  a fortiori A is trivial.)\\n\\n  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\\n  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\\n  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\\n  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\\n  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\\n\\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\\n\\n  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\\n  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\\n  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\\n  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\\n  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\\n  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\\n\\n  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\\n  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\\n  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\\n  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\\n  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\\n  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\\n  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\\n  a nontrivial attack.\\n\\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\\n\\n  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\\n  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\\n  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\\n  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\\n  other decryption P_2.\\n\\n  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\\n  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\\n  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\\n  decrypt further messages.\\n\\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\\n\\n  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\\n  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\\n  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\\n  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\\n  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\\n  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\\n  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\\n  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\\n\\n  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\\n  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\\n  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\\n\\n  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\\n  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\\n  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\\n  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\\n  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\\n\\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\\n\\n  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\\n  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\\n  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\\n  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\\n\\n  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\\n  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\\n  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\\n  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\\n  possible keys.\\n\\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\\n\\n  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\\n  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\\n  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\\n  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\\n  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\\n  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.\\n\\n  We can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its\\n  entropy. This number E is the number of ``real bits of information''\\n  of the key: a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within\\n  2^E guesses. E is defined as the sum of -p_K log_2 p_K, where p_K is\\n  the probability of key K.\\n\",\n",

Other approaches.\\nX-Last-Updated: 1993/04/16\\n\\nArchive-name: cryptography-faq/part06\\nLast-modified: 1993/4/15\\n\\n\\nFAQ for sci.crypt, part 6: Public-Key Cryptography\\n\\nThis is the sixth of ten parts of the sci.crypt FAQ. The parts are\\nmostly independent, but you should read the first part before the rest.\\nWe don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.\\nNotes such as ``[KAH67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.\\n\\nThe sections of this FAQ are available via anonymous FTP to rtfm.mit.edu \\nas /pub/usenet/news.answers/cryptography-faq/part[xx].  The Cryptography \\nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers \\nevery 21 days.\\n\\n\\nContents:\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n* What's RSA?\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n\\n* What is public-key cryptography?\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, we have encryption functions E_K and\\n  decryption functions D_K such that D_K(E_K(P)) = P for any plaintext\\n  P. In a public-key cryptosystem, E_K can be easily computed from some\\n  ``public key'' X which in turn is computed from K. X is published, so\\n  that anyone can encrypt messages. If D_K cannot be easily computed\\n  from X, then only the person who generated K can decrypt messages.\\n  That's the essence of public-key cryptography, published by Diffie\\n  and Hellman in 1976.\\n\\n  In a classic cryptosystem, if you want your friends to be able to\\n  send secret messages to you, you have to make sure nobody other than\\n  them sees the key K. In a public-key cryptosystem, you just publish X,\\n  and you don't have to worry about spies.\\n\\n  This is only the beginning of public-key cryptography. There is an\\n  extensive literature on security models for public-key cryptography,\\n  applications of public-key cryptography, other applications of the\\n  mathematical technology behind public-key cryptography, and so on.\\n\\n* What's RSA?\\n\\n  RSA is a public-key cryptosystem defined by Rivest, Shamir, and\\n  Adleman.  For full details, there is a FAQ available by ftp at\\n  RSA.COM. Here's a small example.\\n\\n  Plaintexts are positive integers up to 2^{512}. Keys are quadruples\\n  (p,q,e,d), with p a 256-bit prime number, q a 258-bit prime number,\\n  and d and e large numbers with (de - 1) divisible by (p-1)(q-1). We\\n  define E_K(P) = P^e mod pq, D_K(C) = C^d mod pq.\\n\\n  Now E_K is easily computed from the pair (pq,e)---but, as far as\\n  anyone knows, there is no easy way to compute D_K from the pair\\n  (pq,e). So whoever generates K can publish (pq,e). Anyone can send a\\n  secret message to him; he is the only one who can read the messages.\\n\\n* Is RSA secure?\\n\\n  Nobody knows. An obvious attack on RSA is to factor pq into p and q.\\n  See below for comments on how fast state-of-the-art factorization\\n  algorithms run. Unfortunately nobody has the slightest idea how to\\n  prove that factorization---or any realistic problem at all, for that\\n  matter---is inherently slow. It is easy to formalize what we mean by\\n  ``RSA is/isn't strong''; but, as Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr., says,\\n  ``Exact definitions appear to be necessary only when one wishes to\\n  prove that algorithms with certain properties do _not_ exist, and\\n  theoretical computer science is notoriously lacking in such negative\\n  results.''\\n\\n* How fast can people factor numbers?\\n\\n  It depends on the size of the numbers. In October 1992 Arjen Lenstra\\n  and Dan Bernstein factored 2^523 - 1 into primes, using about three\\n  weeks of MasPar time. (The MasPar is a 16384-processor SIMD machine;\\n  each processor can add about 200000 integers per second.) The\\n  algorithm there is called the ``number field sieve''; it is quite a\\n  bit faster for special numbers like 2^523 - 1 than for general numbers\\n  n, but it takes time only about exp(O(log^{1/3} n log^{2/3} log n)) in\\n  any case.\\n\\n  An older and more popular method for smaller numbers is the ``multiple\\n  polynomial quadratic sieve'', which takes time exp(O(log^{1/2} n\\n  log^{1/2} log n))---faster than the number field sieve for small n,\\n  but slower for large n. The breakeven point is somewhere between 100\\n  and 150 digits, depending on the implementations.\\n\\n  Factorization is a fast-moving field---the state of the art just a few\\n  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now. If no new methods are\\n  developed, then 2048-bit RSA keys will always be safe from\\n  factorization, but one can't predict the future. (Before the number\\n  field sieve was found, many people conjectured that the quadratic\\n  sieve was asymptotically as fast as any factoring method could be.)\\n\\n* What about other public-key cryptosystems?\\n\\n  We've talked about RSA because it's well known and easy to describe.\\n  But there are lots of other public-key systems around, many of which\\n  are faster than RSA or depend on problems more widely believed to be\\n  difficult. This has been just a brief introduction; if you really want\\n  to learn about the many facets of public-key cryptography, consult the\\n  books and journal articles listed in part 10.\\n\",\n",

Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has\\ninformed me that dust grains _aren\\'t_ good radiators in the far IR,\\nwhich is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field\\nfrom distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.\\nSorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to\\ntake another ISM class :-(\\n\\n  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave\\na talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief\\noverview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of\\nabout 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then\\ngave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is \\nthat there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer\\nsolar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;\\nover time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got\\nscattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter\\nand Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially\\nUranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -\\nwe call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,\\nalready-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through\\nNeptune\\'s atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].\\n\\n  He notes that the two recently discovered \"Kuiper Belt\" objects,\\n1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same \\nmass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the\\nlarger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\\nto be very hard to see.\\n\\n  I hope I haven\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\na howling mistake, it\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\\n\\n  By the way, he\\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He\\'d like\\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\\nmarketplace.\\n\\n  I\\'m just telling you what he said.\\n\\n                          Michael\\n\\n-- \\n-----                                                    Michael Richmond\\n\"This is the heart that broke my finger.\"    richmond@astro.princeton.edu\\n\\n',\n",

Ideas and info gladly accepted.)\\n\\nI do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation\\nfor ANY package is to follow each one\\'s instructions for making the null-\\nmodem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn\\'t\\nreally a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial\\nI wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,\\nbut you should still check your software!\\n\\nI will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is\\na commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a\\nmodem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications\\nhardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA\\nCommunications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the\\nconnector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is\\na \"DB-25\" but IBM has set an alternative \"standard\" of DB-9.  The primary\\nsignals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).\\nThere are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.\\nFor example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate\\nin communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an\\noutput on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that\\nit is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)\\nsignal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that\\'s\\nfive signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)\\nsignal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used\\nto ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok\\nvia the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input\\nto the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)\\nare Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs\\nto the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -\\na signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection\\nto the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.\\nDCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the \"connection\" has been established\\ni.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that\\'s it.  Oh\\nthere are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have\\nexplained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:\\n\\nName    DB-9     DB-25\\n SG       5        7\\n TD       3        2\\n RD       2        3\\nDTR       4       20\\nDSR       6        6\\nDCD       1        8\\nRTS       7        4\\nCTS       8        5\\n RI       9       22\\n\\nNow to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE\\nto a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232\\nsignal definitions don\\'t work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert\\nthe CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these\\nsignals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If\\nthis is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,\\nand crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other\\nend, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send\\ndata has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just\\nsend the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would\\ninclude the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the\\nsoftware area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-\\nware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the\\nserial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to\\nbe used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-\\nLink or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The\\nonly thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also\\nfairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And\\nthat is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE\\'s are responsible for\\nflow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn\\'t possible over-run the\\nDTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the\\nDCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast\\nto the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by\\nasserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can\\nsend.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow\\ncontrol?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,\\none common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no\\nwires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF\\ncommands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware\\nflow control, but the problem is that you can\\'t send binary data because\\nyour data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol\\nsignals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract \"escape\"\\ncodes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-\\nware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to\\ndo it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods\\nis to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair\\ngame.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.\\nBut I bet you\\'ll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with\\nall of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,\\nI am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control\\nthe RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the\\nclear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a\\ndiffernt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling\\nstuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS\\nsignal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-\\ning it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the\\nRTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other\\npossible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain\\nsignals that you don\\'t have (or don\\'t feel like providing because it would\\nmean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting\\nthe DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like\\nthis.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more\\n\"gotcha\" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to\\nsee the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the\\nDTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but\\nthe RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And\\nof course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must\\npass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,\\nif any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not\\nspecify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use\\nthis one.\\n\\n    TD  ------  RD\\n    RD  ------  TD\\n    DTR ------ DSR\\n    DSR ------ DTR\\n    DCD ------ RTS-\\\\\\n  /-RTS ------ DCD |\\n  \\\\-CTS        CTS-/\\n\\n\\nGordon Lang\\n\\n',\n",

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

I have read a few articles about this and know\\n\\nthat two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both\\n\\n\\nideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists\\n\\npublic domain source code for this.\\n\\n    Another \\'rough\\' solition (don\\'t care special cases) is ray-casting\\n\\nwhich is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces\\n\\nconsisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used\\n(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. \"Ray-casting and block model conversion\\nusing a spatial index\". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).\\nBut the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their\\nnormal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?\\nI have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their\\nnormals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed\\nthis is already the case.\\n\\n\\n   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden\\nline removal. It says \"if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing\\n\\ntoward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...\". Again how to make\\nsure ?\\n\\n\\n   Any pointers are welcome ?\\n\\n\\n   Yaohong Jiang\\n   Queen\\'s University\\n   Kingston, Ont.\\n\\n   Jiangy@qucdn.queensu.ca\\n',\n",

The rules, and sometimes the contest Email\\nX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may\\nX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical\\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\\nX\\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\\nX    year.

This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in\\nthe Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.\\n\\n  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should\\naddress this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like\\nit or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be,\\nand isn\\'t.  \\n  I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has\\nforgotten.  This doesn\\'t mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we\\nhave something to learn from the pagan movement.\\n  First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of\\noppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to\\nlive in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ \\ncould have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great\\ndeal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the \\nmale-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have\\nhad to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches.\\n  Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great\\nramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings\\nand our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long\\ntradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress\\nand deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human\\nexperience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option.  \\nChristianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism\\nis an attractive option.\\n  I\\'m not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.)\\nshould be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of\\nsexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated\\nsexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.\\n\\nAlan Terlep\\t\\t\\t\\t    \"Incestuous vituperousness\"\\nOakland University, Rochester, MI\\t\\t\\t\\natterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu\\t\\t\\t\\t   --Melissa Eggertsen\\nRushing in where angels fear to tread.\\t\\t\\n',\n",

While it is true that\\nthe flame I posted does not mention anyone\\'s habitual velocity, friends,\\ndinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate\\nflair and it is short.  The weakness of this type of flame is actually\\nthat it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and\\nboring.  (Witness the Infante thread recently....)\\n\\nThe other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has\\na few weaknesses as well.  In the first place, it can get verbose and \\ntedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly\\nidentify with one side or the other.  In the second, discussing someone\\'s\\npersonal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.\\n(Or is that slanderous?  I can never remember the difference.)  This leads\\nto a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a BAD THING.\\nFinally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  I can\\'t haul my\\nbig dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which\\nactually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter\\nto my use and flamage in general.\\n\\nIn summary, Blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  While it may\\nbe the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily\\nweaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor\\napplicable.  You also probably couldn\\'t outrun a tennis ball with a\\nflatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and I\\'ll bet you and your \\nmotorcycle lean to the outside while turning.

Image annotation software\\n=============================\\n\\na. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in\\n  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn\\'t normally stored\\n  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a\\n  rasterfile.\\n\\nb.

I\\'m not\\n  sure exactly what they are.\\n  You can ftp the idraw\\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\\n\\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

If you have questions, problems, or comments, send\\n  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.\\n\\nMicrostation Imager\\n-------------------\\n  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS\\n  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment.

It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease. By \\nitself, Regeneron is testing CNTF in patients with arnyotrophic lateral \\nsclerosis (commonly known as Lou Gehrig\\'s disease). \\n     Regeneron Pharlnaceuticals, Inc., based in Tarrytown, New York, is a \\nleader in the discovery and development of biotechnology-based compounds for \\nthe treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, peripheral neuropathies and nerve \\ninjuries, which affect more than seven million Americans.

These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

       " \"From: smb@research.att.com (Steven Bellovin)\\nSubject: Clipper -- some new thoughts\\nOrganization: AT&T Bell Laboratories\\nLines: 55\\n\\nI'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\\n\\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\\nthe subkeys even more.\\n\\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\\nthe warrant.\\n\\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\\nlong.\\n\\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\\nwithout the back door.\\n\\nThe cryptographic protocol, though, is another matter.  I see no valid\\nreasons for keeping it secret, and -- as I hope I've shown above -- there\\nare a lot of ways to do things that aren't (quite) as bad.\\n\",\n",

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

The trap is the easy way out.\\n\\tFor yourself, I think it would be a good idea to realize that the\\ndemographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,\\nand much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. You\\'re\\ngoing to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic\\ngroup or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors\\nleading to that dysfunction. With ethnic minorities it is more usually than\\nnot, as I said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.\\n\\tIf, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few\\nBlacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations Whites, you\\'d see the crime\\nstatistics reflecting the dysfunction of those White people. Would you then\\nworry about whther your children would begin to see Whites as undesireable\\nor whatever? The trap springs into action when our innate compunction to\\ndefine \"us\" and \"other\" raises its little voice. The trap becomes dangerous\\nwhen we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational\\nhumans.\\n\\tIt\\'s interesting that Blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the\\n*most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. I don\\'t know the racial\\nmakeup of Phoenix, so I can\\'t speak to your situation. However, I live in\\nSan Francisco, a city that loves to tout its \"ethnic diversity\". Here, we\\nhave Black gangs, Hispanic gangs, Asian (yes, the \"model minority\") gangs,\\nand even a few White gangs. The Asian gangs have become a particularly\\ntroublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (I think) to their\\npropensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. But ask people on\\nthe street and they\\'ll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that Black gangs and\\ncrime are what they most fear. During the \"disturbance\" in Los Angeles last\\nyear many of the rioters and looters were not Black. Some were even White! I\\nremember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs\\nwhere there were maybe one or two Blacks at most! My perceptions, gleaned\\nfrom TV news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives\\nthat live in Los Angeles. This may have been the country\\'s first truly\\nmulti-ethnic riot. Yet I know from face-to-face and online discussion that\\nin the minds of America the popular perception is that it was a *Black*\\nriot!\\n\\tIn closing, I\\'d like to say that you raise some interesting points\\nthat really need discussion. Our country has spent too long ignoring the\\nracism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. As\\na people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem\\nbecomes compounded *daily*. We cannot afford to do it much longer. I truly\\nbelieve that the  well-being of ALL OF US depends on changing our current\\ncourse of denial and repression.\\n\\tI wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,\\nluck in avoiding the \"trap\". \\n\\tPeace, my brother.\\n\\t\\t\\tm.\\n-- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHokh\\'Ton\\t:\\tThe Crystal Wind is the Storm,\\n  mdouglas@netcom.com\\t:\\t and the Storm is Data,\\nMichael Douglas-Llyr\\t:\\t  and the Data is Life.\\n\\t\\t\\t:\\t\\t---Player\\'s Litany (The Long Run)\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",

This could be encrypted after\\nthe message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with\\na message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting\\nblock.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*\\nsure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be\\nstronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's\\nunbreakable.\\n \\n   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's\\nto include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,\\neither.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your\\npad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your\\nopponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext\\nin a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going\\non.\\n \\n   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide\\nwhether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use\\nof 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about\\nhalf.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a\\nguess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying\\nto see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the\\nspoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-\\nsynched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.\\n \\n   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure\\nas a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.\\n \\n   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together\\nto get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy\\nhas no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either.\\nAny change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess\\nof what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?\\n \\n   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random\\nbits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages\\njust as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.\\nIn fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed\\nmessage with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about\\nthat.\\n \\n   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the\\none-time pad?\\n \\n   --John Kelsey\\n\",\n",

After recieving much assistance from various T.P.G.\\ntype folks, I wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph,\\nand surprise, surprise, surprise, they published it.  The text follows.\\nThe Colorado Daily, btw, is the University of Colorado (Boulder) student\\n(I think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup, but every little bit, i guess...\\n\\n(The title was the only thing they changed/added)\\n\\n\"Gun Stats\"\\n\\nThe Daily recently reprinted an article from the\\nWall Street Journal, primarily concerned with Paxton\\nQuigley, author of \"Armed and Female.\"  The article,\\nin turn, cites a misleading statistic that was originally\\nreported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The\\narticle states, \"A study... found that a gun in the home\\nwas 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,\\nspouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.\"  This\\nis an often-quoted statistic, and it is misleading for sev-\\neral reasons, outlined below:\\n\\nThe study gives the impression that, if you own a\\ngun, the likelihood that you will successfully use it to\\ndefend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned\\nagainst you.  The study, however, fails to take into\\naccount cases where a law-abiding citizen uses a gun\\nto thwart a crime, without actually killing the perpe-\\ntrator.\\n\\nThe study actually refers to \\'acquaintances\\' rather\\nthan \\'friend\\'.  This would include the friendly neigh-\\nborhood thug who shows up like clockwork, every\\nmonth, the second your grandmother cashes her social\\nsecurity check.  Possibly an acquaintance, but hardly a\\nfriend.\\n\\nThe NEJM study is based on the immediate dis-\\nposition of cases and fails to take into account cases\\noriginally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be\\nself-defense.  Especially considering the small sample\\nsize (396), taking these events into account has a sub-\\nstantial effect on the 43:1 ratio quoted.\\n\\nCriminologist Gary Kleck gives us a slightly dif-\\nerent statistic: a gun is 33 times more likely to be\\nused, successfully, by a private citizen against an\\naggressor than it is to kill anyone at all.  Further, per-\\nsons defending themselves from aggression by using a\\ngun fare better than those who resist vicimization by\\nsome other means, or who offer no resistance at all.\\nStatistics available from the FBI and other agencies\\nalso show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be\\nused by a non-criminal to defend against criminal threat\\nthan to be used to commit criminal homicide, 535 times\\nmore likely to be used to defend against a criminal\\nthreat than to accidentally kill anybody, and 50 times\\nmore likely to defend against criminal threat than to be\\nused to commit suicide.\\n\\nIt is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can\\nbe proved by uncritical quotation of statistics.

The estimated population\\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\\n of Transcaucasia\\'s Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \\n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province\\'s ethnic character \\n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \\n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \\n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \\n (See also Map 1.

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today\\'s modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\"Structure of the State\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts. These cannot be \\n discharged, replaced or retired by executive authorities except for the\\n reasons clearly stated by the appropriate laws. There are three categories\\n of courts in the Turkish judiciary system:\\n\\n - Courts of justice deal with legal, commercial and criminal cases. The \\n   decisions of these courts may be reviewed by the supreme court of justice\\n   upon the appeal of the parties involved.\\n - The decisions or functions of the executive power (including the Prime\\n   Minister and Ministers or any governmental department) can be appealed in\\n   administrative courts if these functions or decisions are against the law.\\n   The decisions of these administrative courts may also be reviewed by the\\n   high administrative court.\\n\\n The laws and decisions of the Grand National Assembly can be examined by the\\n \"Constitutional Court\" if they contradict the Constitution. If found\\n contradictory, this court may cancel the decisions or laws of the Parliament.\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\\n\\nLinguistic Grounds\\n\\nfootnotes\\n___________________________\\n22  W.L. Petersen, \"Can ARSENOKOITAI Be Translated by \\'Homosexuals\\'? (I Cor\\n6:9; I Tim 1:10)\"  VC 40 (1986): 187-91.\\n23 K.J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1.\\n24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato\\'s writings may not reflect\\nAthenian society, or that the speakers in \"Symposium\" may not reflect Plato\\'s\\nview.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover\\n(Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below \\n25 The translation is that of W.R.M. Lamb, Plato:  Symposioum LCL (Cambridge:\\nHarvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to \"adulteress.\"  If there is\\na homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there must\\nalso be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.\\n26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love\\nthe male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young; \\nthe latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent\\n(181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered a\\ndisgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the\\ncowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of \"homophobia\"?).  In Athens it\\nwas \"more honorable to love openly than in secret\" (182d -an ancient expression\\nof \"coming out of the closet\").  Mutality was present (\"this compels lover and\\nbeloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue,\" 184b).\\n    For Petersen to label the Symposium a \"possible\" exception to his position\\nis inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greek\\nsociety hundreds of years before the time of Christ.\\n27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in\\nPlato\\'s works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of those\\nwho \"habituate themselves\" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws\\n3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexuality\\nhad become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement of\\nAlexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the \"some men, from birth, fhave a natural\\naversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well\\nnot to marry\" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian\\'s\\nCodex of laws (it referes to those \"who have been consumed by this disease\" as\\nin need of renouncing \"there plague,\" as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes\\n48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  Finally\\nThucydides 2.45.2 has: \"Great is you glory if you fall not below the standard\\nwhich nature has set for your sex.\"\\n     Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers\\n(Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutual\\nhomosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be either\\ngay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs\\n(Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have\\nexisted in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutual\\nhomosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44).\\n28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary on\\nDeuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition of\\ncross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a \"mere rule of conventional propriety.\" \\nSee also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144.\\n29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous\\ncitizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as \"against nature\" (para\\nphosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH\\n3:4-5 the sodomites changed the \"order of nature.\"  THe Jewish writers, Philo\\n(On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199;\\n2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as \"against nature.\"  Finally,, first\\ncentury moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke of\\nhomosexuality as \"against nature.\"  Christians clearly did not invent the\\nlabels \"natural\" and \"unnatural\".

Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and \\noften by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some\\nrecently rare power with their bats.\\n\\nBelcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the\\ngame progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\nTomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and \\nBarry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys\\n(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a Tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nIn fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would \\nlater score on Reggie Sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nThe fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second\\ndouble of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the \\nleft field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on\\nTom Prince\\'s two-base passed ball.  \\n\\nThe Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the\\nfifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second \\nbeing of the \"bunt\" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a \\nfoul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith \"K\\'d\" to end any Pittsburgh hope.\\n\\nPittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,\\nMoeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings\\nwork.\\n\\nBarry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played \\nbruised his right thumb.

       " 'From: alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz (Alastair Thomson)\\nSubject: Does \\'Just/justifiable War\\' exist?\\nOrganization: University of Otago\\nLines: 107\\n\\nHi there netters,\\nI have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on:\\nIs there such a thing as a \\'justifible\\' war? \\n\\nWhat I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \"All war  \\nis wrong\", or \"Some war is justifiable\". \\n\\nTo get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  \\nquestion. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \\nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \\nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \\nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \\nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \\nhardware as the very best a \\'real\\' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \\ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \\npast and present. \\n\\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \\nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \\nto God\\'s commandments to love one another, especially one\\'s enemies.\\n\\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \\nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \\ntechnology I so admire - The F117A \\'Stealh\\' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \\nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \\nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam\\'s  \\nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \\nMig\\'s in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \\ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \\nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \\nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \\npilot is simply a \\'target\\'. Dead civilians are \\'collateral damage\\'. These  \\neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \\nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \\nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\\n\\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \\nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \\nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \\nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry \\'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \\nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on \\'justifiable\\' war.\\n\\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \\n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \\nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \\nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \\nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \\nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\\n\\n1. The Second World War\\n\\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\\n\\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \\n\\t\\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n2. Korean war\\n\\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\\n\\t  communism vs. capitalism.\\n\\t- Probably not justifiable.\\n\\n3. Vietnam\\n\\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\\n\\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\\n\\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\\n\\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\\n\\t- Other factors such as genocide.\\n\\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\\n\\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\\n\\t- Genocide - so called \\'Ethnic Cleansing\\'\\n\\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable\\n\\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \\nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \\nor Israel.\\n\\t- My feelings in this are simple\\n\\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\\n\\t- I love the New Zealand government\\'s stand on banning all nuclear\\n\\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\\n\\t- Never justifiable.\\n\\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused.

Grocery stores do not\\nattempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of\\nit.  In fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader \\nfor other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  \\n\\nBut the evidence does not support this contention.  Rather, it appears that\\nprice controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of\\nservice and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide \\ncomparable benefits.  Providers continue to profit from RD, they simply\\nmake less on each treatment than they would have if the price had \\nrisen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.\\n\\nThere is no question that had price controls forced the price of RD \\nsubstantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday\\npredictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction\\nof service, lagging technological development, etc.  Likewise, it appears\\nthat in the VA and armed forces medical care systems, where providers \\nare government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  \\n(RD patients in the VA system in Spokane, for example, must travel to\\nSeattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  \\n\\nThe bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government \\nintervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial\\nresults for both providers and consumers.  Claims that \"government\\nbureaucracy\" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace\\nshould take such such cases into account.\\n\\njsh\\n\\n>\\n>=Mark\\n--\\nSteve Hendricks                        |  DOMAIN:  steveh@thor.ISC-BR.COM   \\n\"One thing about data, it sure does cut|  UUCP:    ...!uunet!isc-br!thor!steveh\\n the bulls**t.\" - R.

Is\\nit because too many people take French and German in college to make\\nthe accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.\\nSince the provincial wings of the CMA are the ones that go to bat when\\nthe fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors\\nwere just cackling when they realized the CMA would grow in strength\\nrather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized\\nmedicine approaches like Britain\\'s National Health Service.\\n\\n>\"`You\\'ve got to remember, you\\'ve got a waiting list as well, but it\\'s  \\n>not as obvious.

In the States you ration by ability to pay.\\'\"  \\n\\nFor non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why\\ncertain procedures are in scarcer demand.  I have MD friends who can\\'t\\nmake a living as specialists back in Manitoba not due to the insurance\\nrates but because they won\\'t get enough customers -- the CMA medical\\nmonopoly\\'s grip on doctors licencing (as in the US) aside -- so they\\nmust move to larger places.  However, this does not refute debunking\\nof waiting lines for urgent AND routine care, as has been done in the\\nU.S. by Consumers Reports, health policy studies cited by Prof. Dennis\\nE. Shea on USENET, CNN, NYT, etc.\\n\\nDoug Fierro has posted a NYT article from 3 weeks ago about Canada\\'s\\nhealth insurance approach, on Talk.politics.medicine.  There is one\\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\\n\\n>WOULDN\\'T NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE MEAN THAT AMERICANS WHO ARE NOW  \\n>FULLY INSURED MIGHT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR LESS?  \\n>\\n>In Canada, provincial insurance covers all health costs except dental  \\n>care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs, ambulance service, and private  \\n>hospital rooms, -- so many Canadians do end up buying some private  \\n>insurance. A policy to cover all of these things runs about #40 to $40  \\n>a month.  \\n\\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\\nbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\\ncovered for basic care.\\n\\nAt that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approach\\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\\n\\n>******************************************************************  \\n>\\n>WOULDN\\'T FREE CARE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RUN TO THE DOCTOR FOR EVERY  \\n>ACHE AND PAIN?  \\n>\\n>People who get free treatment *do* go to the doctor and hospital about  \\n>a third more often than those who have to pay a share of their medical  \\n>bills.  \\n>\\n>Still, Canadians -- who pay nothing at the doctor\\'s -- have a lower  \\n>per-person health bill than we do.\\n\\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\\nnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\\n\\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer \\n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n>ISN\\'T THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY JUST TOO BIG  \\n>AND POWERFUL TO KILL?  \\n>\\n>Dismantling the health segment of our insurance industry would be  \\n>\"politically thorny,\" in the quiet words of one advocate for a  \\n>national plan. Some 1,200 firms now sell more than $192 billion in  \\n>health insurance. They\\'d put up a hard fight. Not only has the industry  \\n>grown eightfold since Canada shut down its own health insurers, but \\n>our government leaves politicians more open to lobbyists than does  \\n>Canada\\'s parliamentary system.\\n\\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\\njust that it doesn\\'t cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.  In Quebec\\nlast spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against\\nany thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province\\'s\\npublic health insurance plan.\\n\\ngld\\n--\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\nGary L.

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.

       " 'From: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)\\nSubject: REVIEW: Audi S4 quattro\\nOrganization: skulls \\'r us\\nLines: 175\\nDistribution: world\\nReply-To: eliot@engr.washington.edu (eliot)\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: lanmola.engr.washington.edu\\n\\nIt\\'s been a while since I\\'ve reviewed a car but today I paid a visit\\nto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he\\nmakes a not too sucessful living selling them.\\n\\nWithout further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:\\n\\n\\n1) Servotronic steering:\\n\\n[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the\\nname for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and\\nused in Audis and BMWs.]\\n\\nI have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past\\ncouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of\\nthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to\\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I\\'d be much\\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\\nruined.\\n\\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\\nsome makes it through to the driver\\'s hands.  So there is feel and\\nthere is accuracy in the S4\\'s steering.  But there is also room for\\nimprovement.  I consider the S4\\'s steering to be better than the\\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\\n\\n\\n2) Engine\\n\\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there\\'s only 2.2\\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\\n\\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\\na heavy car, one\\'s body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\\n\\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I\\'d say that\\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I\\'d rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi\\'s own V8 is also far more musical,\\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\\nmatch its grunt.\\n\\nThe only hint of the engine\\'s true capacity occurs when one is taking\\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \\nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\\n\\n\\n3) Chassis\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \\n\\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4\\'s body feels like it has been carved\\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4\\'s ride quality will\\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\\npony cars.\\n\\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\\nable to test the car\\'s cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX\\'s clinical\\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\\n\\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\\nwell too, though I\\'ve read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400\\'s fade performance is nothing to\\nbrag about; neither is the Q45\\'s or the Legend\\'s.  Brake fade these days\\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody\\'s attention is focused on\\nanti-lock capability.\\n\\n\\n4) Comfort\\n\\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the \\'92 S4.  All the expected\\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\\nbecause Audi hasn\\'t gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \\n\\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\\n\\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn\\'t\\nconsider the Lexus\\' advantage in this area to be significant enough\\nto sway a potential buyer.\\n\\n\\n5) Conclusion\\n\\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\\nit doesn\\'t produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker\\noffers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is\\nworth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also \\ntop notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant \\nautomatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series\\nAudis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my\\nthumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being\\nall out exciting and intoxicating.\\n\\n\\neliot\\n\\n',\n",

It allows composite\\nmultimedia objects to be built from media objects.\\n\\nSpecifically, it adds audio and video objects to the classes available\\nin InterViews 3.0.1/3.1, and it does so without changing the\\nsource code for the original classes (though several configuration\\nfiles for InterViews need to be changed via a patch file). \\n \\nCurrently, the Xavier audio classes are only supported on SUN\\nworkstations with an audio interface, such as the SPARCstation2.\\n\\nXavier has been tested in the following environments:\\n\\nSUN:\\n  Machine : SPARCserver470 SPARCstation-IPC\\n  OS      : SUN-OS4.1.1 or later\\n  C++     : SUN C++ ver2.1\\n\\nNEC(EWS):\\n  Machine : EWS4800/210,230\\n  OS      : EWS-UX/V(Rel4.0) WSOS41 Release5.1,Release5.2\\n  C++     : C++ Release3.1\\n\\nIt can be obtained via anonymous ftp from \\n\\n         interviews.stanford.edu in /pub/contrib/\\n          (Xavier.large-demo.tar, and Xavier.tar)\\n\\nWe are preparing a mailing-list for information regarding Xavier.\\nIf you are interested, please contact\\n               \\n                   xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp. \\n\\nI will add your e-mail address to our list.\\n\\n[Reference]\\no Rei Hamakawa, Hizekazu Sakagami, Jun Rekimoto:\\n  Audio and Video Extension to Graphical Interface Toolkits,\\n  The Third International Workshop on Network and Operating\\n  System Support for Digital Audio and Video, San Diego, 1992\\n\\n***********************************************************************\\n* _                                                                   *\\n*  \\\\ \\\\      Rei Hamakawa (e-mail: rei@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp)               *\\n*   |o|                                                               *\\n*   |o|     C & C Systems Research Laboratories                       *\\n*   |o| __  NEC Corporation                                           *\\n*  O| || /  1-1, Miyazaki 4-Chome,      TEL : +81-44-856-2271         *\\n*  O| || |  Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki,       FAX : +81-44-856-2232         *\\n*  O| \\\\/ |  Kanagawa 216 JAPAN                                        *\\n*    \\\\__/                                                             *\\n***********************************************************************\\n\",\n",

You can use any\\nold vga/svga monitor with a centris.  You do need an adaptor (I use a\\nMac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two\\nmachines.  THe adaptor I have mentioned will convert a centris to a\\nthree row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.\\n\\n    NOW, the special interest disclaimer.\\n The above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400\\nresolution.  IF your monitor will sync to 56Khz horizontal the above\\nadaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (I prefer this on my\\n1604s).\\n\\nTHen You have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.

In addition to this to\\nfind out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the\\nsync rates elsewhere as ads like Hardware that fits\\n(*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most\\nfavorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a\\nspecialized application video card).(i.e. \"well you can get a resolution\\n1168x832 on this $5,  9\" \"super smelly sock\" monitor that will let you\\ndisplay TWO FULL PAGES side by side.

At this point,  many\\ncongresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,\\nfor a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best\\npossible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his\\nposition as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,\\nCongressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long\\nrecord of support and interest in space development, and helped\\npass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements\\nAct.                      \\n        There is a small group of activists in southern California \\nwho have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.\\nWe are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown\\nabout the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space\\nconstituents to let him know that they care about getting\\nAmerica back to the Moon.\\n        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert \\nfor space activists to call or write George Brown to have him\\nintroduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late\\nspring, 1993.\\n        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's\\noffice. As more is known, it will be passed on.\\n        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support\\nthe bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For\\nany bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:\\neither the bill must reflect widespread national support for an\\nissue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be\\npropelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or\\nhave widespread support within Congress, due to small, but\\nwidespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,\\nby necessity, must choose.                    \\n        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources \\nData Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number\\nof congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish\\nthis, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support\\nthe Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the\\nbill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a\\ncongressperson's staff review a bill.\\n        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet\\nintroduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently\\nwritten. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists\\nand politicians.\\n        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please\\nrequest a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service\\naddress), or contact your local chapter of the National Space\\nSociety).\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n\",\n",

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.

The passenger\\nseats are not designed for long rides.  The passenger positions aren\\'t\\neven usually designed for short rides.  I ended up torturing my knees and my\\nback by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  One of the\\nreasons I originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had\\na BMW. :)\\n\\nI\\'d suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains\\nor some such.  Then see how much pain she\\'s in, and proceed from there.\\n\\nThe best advice I\\'d give a beginning passenger:\\n\\n- Don\\'t get on the bike until the rider says its OK, and work out some sort\\n  signal for the rider to tell you when its OK to get off.  After I get on \\n  the bike I squeeze my riders hips to tell that I\\'m ready, and at the stop\\n  he nods his head to show its OK for me to get off.\\n\\n- Keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  Don\\'t wiggle (unless your rider\\n  asks you to :)\\n\\n- The best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  Echo the movements\\n  and lean of your rider.  Look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,\\n  but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.\\n\\n- Get used to your rider\\'s shifting style (Riders:  use a reasonably\\n  consistent shifting style).  Avoid \"helmet bonk.\"  Helmet bonk is \\n  when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change\\n  in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  It\\n  gets old real fast.\\n\\n- When pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep\\n  your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  Putting your hands\\n  on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you\\'re in pain,\\n  but I\\'m told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.\\n\\n- Switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be \\n  sure and squeeze your thighs while you\\'re doing it so your rider knows you\\'re\\n  still there. :)  The guard rail isn\\'t as safe as holding onto your rider.\\n\\n- Don\\'t be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you\\'re in pain or\\n  losing feeling in your feet.  Passenger seats are not generally designed \\n  for comfort.  Work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n*********************************************************\\nLaura Lemay                              lemay@netcom.com\\nwriter of trifles in shadows and blood\\n*********************************************************\\n\\n',\n",

Sex, or Christianity?\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\\n\\n\\tWhat\\'s more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\\n\\tof other human beings?\\n\\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\\n\\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\\nfoster the children they beget and support their children\\'s mothers.\\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus\\' citation of\\nthat passage.)\\n\\n\\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\\n\\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\\n\\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\\n\\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\\n\\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\\n\\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\\n\\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\\n\\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God\\'s grace\\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\\n\\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\\n\\n>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\\n>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\\n\\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\\n\\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God\\'s creation, that can develop to\\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

Bede is a great\\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\\nnot make it more so.\\n\\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\\nFestival.\"\\n\\nHowever, Bede\\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\\n\\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n\\n\\n[No, I\\'m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\\nof celebrating Easter.

Reproduced without permission.]\\n\\n\\n\\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\\n\\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \\nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \\n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\\nsour as well.\\n\\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\\n\\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \\nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\\n\\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\\n\\n\\nRefs:  \\n\\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis\\nof the Logos Incarnate.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI guess that adresses your question adequately.\\n\\nAs for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the\\ndiscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see\\nhow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an\\nendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief\\nanswer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church \\nregarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.\\nis exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\\n\",\n",

(It needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the \\nuser enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual \\ndesktop.) Substitute \"toplevel\" with your top-most widget here (similar code \\nshould work for Xlib-only applications; just use your top Window):\\n\\n     unsigned long valuemask;\\n     XSetWindowAttributes attributes;\\n\\n     /* Ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed. */\\n     valuemask = CWDontPropagate | CWCursor;\\n     attributes.do_not_propagate_mask =  (KeyPressMask | KeyReleaseMask |\\n         ButtonPressMask | ButtonReleaseMask | PointerMotionMask);\\n     attributes.cursor = XCreateFontCursor(XtDisplay(toplevel), XC_watch);\\n\\n     /* The window will be as big as the display screen, and clipped by\\n        its own parent window, so we never have to worry about resizing */\\n     XCreateWindow(XtDisplay(toplevel), XtWindow(toplevel), 0, 0,\\n         65535, 65535, (unsigned int) 0, 0, InputOnly,\\n         CopyFromParent, valuemask, &attributes);\\n\\nwhere the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen,\\nparticularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than\\n32767.\\n\\nWhen you want to use this busy cursor, map and raise this window; to go back to\\nnormal, unmap it. This will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse\\nevents; depending on precisely how the window manager works, it may or may not\\nhave a similar effect on keystrokes as well.\\n\\nIn addition, note also that most of the Xaw widgets support an XtNcursor \\nresource which can be temporarily reset, should you merely wish to change the\\ncursor without blocking pointer events.\\n\\n[thanks to Andrew Wason (aw@cellar.bae.bellcore.com), Dan Heller \\n(argv@sun.com), and mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu; 11/90,5/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 129)  How do I fork without hanging my parent X program?\\n\\n\\tAn X-based application which spawns off other Unix processes which \\ncontinue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its \\nchildren are terminated; the children inherit from the parent the open X \\nconnection to the display. \\n\\tWhat you need to do is fork; then, immediately, in the child process, \\n\\t\\tclose (ConnectionNumber(XtDisplay(widget)));\\nto close the file-descriptor in the display information.

If your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which \\nmight be while the function you are calling is already executing), it can leave\\nthe library in an inconsistent state. Note that the ANSI C standard points\\nout that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem specific to\\nXlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other functions which may be\\ncalled safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by \\nXlib or Xt functions.\\n\\tYou can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt\\nhandler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which\\nhas previously been added.\\n\\n\\tNote: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly \\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n[Thanks to Pete Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) and Donna Converse \\n(converse@expo.lcs.mit.EDU), 5/92]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 131)  What are these \"Xlib sequence lost\" errors?\\n\\n\\tYou may see these errors if you issue Xlib requests from an Xlib error \\nhandler, or, more likely, if you make calls which generate X requests to Xt or \\nXlib from a signal handler, which you shouldn\\'t be doing in any case. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 132)  How can my Xt program handle socket, pipe, or file input?\\n\\n\\tIt\\'s very common to need to write an Xt program that can accept input \\nboth from a user via the X connection and from some other file descriptor, but \\nwhich operates efficiently and without blocking on either the X connection or \\nthe other file descriptor.\\n\\tA solution is use XtAppAddInput(). After you open your file descriptor,\\nuse XtAppAddInput() to register an input handler. The input handler will be \\ncalled every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your \\nprogram\\'s attention. Write the input handler like you would any other Xt \\ncallback, so it does its work quickly and returns.  It is important to use only\\nnon-blocking I/O system calls in your input handlers.\\n\\tMost input handlers read the file descriptor, although you can have an \\ninput handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.\\n\\tBe careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.\\nYou will find that the function is called even when there isn\\'t input pending.\\nXtAppAddInput() is actually working as it is supposed to. The input handler is \\ncalled whenever the file descriptor is READY to be read, not only when there is\\nnew data to be read.

The reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap,\\nset it to be the background pixmap of a window, and then free the pixmap. The \\nwindow keeps this background, but the pixmap itself is destroyed.  If you\\'re \\nsure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap), you can use XClearArea() \\nto clear a region to the background color and then use XGetImage() to read \\nback that pixel.

Note \\nthat there is no X notion of a \"transparent color index\".\\n\\t- a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny \\nwindows, but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.\\n\\t- a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent\\nwindow or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application\\nwindow with information; if so, you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors\\nthat will appear properly.\\n\\n[thanks to der Mouse, mouse@lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, 3/92; see also\\nThe X Journal 1:4 for a more complete answer, including code samples for this\\nlast option]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 140)  Why doesn\\'t GXxor produce mathematically-correct color values?\\n\\n\\tWhen using GXxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a\\nbackground of black, for example, should produce white. However, the drawing\\noperation does not work on RGB values but on colormap indices. The color that\\nthe resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually\\nrandom unless you have actually filled it in yourself. [On many X servers Black\\nand White often 0/1 or 1/0; programs taking advantage of this mathematical\\ncoincidence will break.]\\n\\tIf you want to be combining colors with GXxor, then you should be \\nallocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen\\npre-computed values.\\n\\tIf you want to use GXxor simply to switch between two colors, then you \\ncan take the shortcut of setting the background color in the GC (graphics \\ncontext) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over \\nred, say, the result is blue, and when it draws over blue the result is red. \\nThis foreground value is itself the XOR of the colormap indices of red and \\nblue.\\n\\n[Thanks to Chris Flatters (cflatter@zia.aoc.nrao.EDU) and Ken Whaley \\n(whaley@spectre.pa.dec.com), 2/91]\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject: 141)  Why does every color I allocate show up as black?\\n\\n\\tMake sure you\\'re using 16 bits and not 8.

The X server assigns IDs to windows and other resources (actually,\\nthe server assigns some bits, the client others), and any application that \\nknows the ID can manipulate the resource [almost any X server resource, except\\nfor GCs and private color cells, can be shared].\\n\\tThe problem you face is how to disseminate the window ID to multiple \\napplications. A simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the\\napplications\\' running on different machines) is in the first application to \\ncreate a specially-named property on the root-window and put the window ID into\\nit. The second application then retrieves the property, whose name it also\\nknows, and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.\\n\\t[Note: this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first\\napplication running, and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned\\nin the Question about using window IDs on remote displays.]\\n\\tNote also that you will still need to coordinate any higher-level \\ncooperation among your applications. \\n\\tNote also that two processes can share a window but should not try to \\nuse the same server connection.

The SCIF is located at\\n|> Mykotronx.\\n|> \\n|> At the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\n|> escrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\\n|> 80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\\n|> 80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\\n|> keys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\\n|> function of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\\n\\nOK, I\\'ve got a big problem with all of this.  How in the world do you\\nexpect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved\\nin this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at \\na time:  give me a break.  And how long does all of this take?  Even if\\nit is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to \\nturn out 300 of these things.  How long do you suppose it will take to\\nprogram those 10,000 chips mentioned above?  This is highly impractical!\\n\\n|> To see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\n|> telephone security device (as it will be).

It was explained that two news photographers were found \\non the compound earlier this morning without permission.  It was explained \\nto the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer \\nturning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous \\nby a Texas Ranger surveying the site. (!)  \\n\\nThe two photographers were said to be currently in jail and \\nthe press were warned to follow the authorities\\' guidelines.  \\nIt was also emphasized that the survey of the \"crime\" scene at this \\npoint was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.\\nThe press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the \\nsite has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.  \\n\\nThat is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my \\nmemory.

It will \\nprobably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.\\n\\nMy opinions:\\n-----------\\nI find this disturbing.

We must examine \\nthe underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch \\nand socio-political movement we participate in.  Ideas are important.  \\nPhilosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our \\nlives.  They are the basis from which we live our lives of love and \\nservice.  The command to love God with all one\\'s mind means no fuzzy-\\nheaded drifting from idea to idea. \\n\\n> and that consumerism and our rapacious style of living\\n> are so rarely called by their appropriate name: Greed.\\n\\nOne Christian who acknowledges this is the Pope.  It is a frequent theme \\nin his writings.  Indeed, thoughtful Christians from most traditions \\nrecognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of Christians.  It \\ntoo is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  Thank you, Jack, for \\npointing out the parallel. \\n\\nJayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org\\n',\n",

A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!\\n\\t\\n\\tRobert Andolina (former Buffalonian living in Minneapolis)\\n\\trandolin@polisci.umn.edu\\n',\n",

I won the battle but \\nlost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was \\ndefective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below \\nmarket value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average \\nretail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but \\nthe decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the \\nCouncil of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the \\nfact that if you have an automobile that does not \\ndepreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive \\nto deal with you.  There is no way that the \\nmanufacturer can loose because they can turn around and \\nsell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded \\na repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet\\'s \\nrepresentative at the hearing tends to support this \\npoint of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not \\nseem to take the proceeding very seriously.\\n\\nI decided to take the repurchase, even though I am \\ngetting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have \\nto deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon \\nmyself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on \\nthe Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to \\nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \\nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \\na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \\nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \\nfor my insurance.\\n\\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \\nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \\nthat required attention included the transmission, \\nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \\nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \\ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \\nleast four attempts.\\n\\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \\nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \\npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \\nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.\\n\\njackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com\\n\\n',\n",

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \\n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \\n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \\n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\\n\\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\\n      4x4s can run the course.\\n     \\n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\\n\\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\\n  of the course - we don\\'t want to have to separate someone\\'s bumper\\n  from their vehicle :) .\\n\\nThe Particulars:\\n\\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\\n* A valid drivers license is required\\n* Suggested equipment:\\n      CB Radio\\n      Compass\\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\\n      Clip Board and Pencil\\n* No alcohol during rally\\n* For more information contact\\n   Gary (815)727-3415\\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\\n   Brian (708)979-6083\\n\\n\\n                                            __\\n              Instant                      /\\\\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\\\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\\n------|---------------------------------------------\\n Exit |              |             |         ^\\n 257  |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |              |             |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |                            |         |\\n      |       Rt80                 |         v\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n      |                            | Exit\\n      |                            | 130B\\n      |                            |\\n   \\n',\n",

What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \\nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\\nthe RC time constant?

Neil Smith by Cathy Smith\\n\\n\\n                         THE LIES OF TEXAS\\n\\nOkay, what have we learned?\\n\\nFor reasons still being kept secret, a federal agency already known \\n-- well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative \\ncommittees over the years -- for a longstanding, violent disregard\\nof the law, invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and \\npersonal habits they abominate, violating his rights under the \\nFirst, Second, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to \\nthe Constitution. \\n\\nThe man and his followers fight back, killing four of the outlaw \\nagency\\'s minions, wounding many more, and suffering their own \\nlosses in the process. The agency responds by cutting off his \\nelectricity, water, and especially his contact with the outside \\nworld. They are then free to say anything at all about him -- in \\npronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency \\nfinds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit \\neager to gain credit for \"straightening out the mess\" -- and, more \\nimportantly, to script his side of the subsequent \"negotiations\" \\nany way they please. \\n\\nThe impasse lasts almost two months, ironically, at the same time \\nfour L.A. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a \\nsingle individual, sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. \\nArmored vehicles surround the house, already ringed with snipers \\nusing scoped, high-powered rifles. Loudspeakers playing obnoxious \\nrecords at the highest possible volume, and searchlights, deprive \\nthose in the house of sleep (in the aftermath, nobody in authority \\nwill mention the effect this technique, originated by North Korean \\nCommunists as a battle tactic, may have had on their judgment). \\n\\nFinally -- another irony -- on the 50th anniversary of the rising \\nof the Warsaw Ghetto, some of the armor punches holes in the house \\nand gas of some kind is injected. The house bursts into flame and \\nis reduced to ashes in less than an hour. At least 80 lives, \\nincluding those of more than a dozen children, are snuffed out. \\n\\nSpokesmen for the outlaw agencies, the Attorney General, and the \\nPresident all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme: \\nblame the victim. \\n\\nHe had illegal weapons -- as soon as they can be prepared in a \\nsecret government workshop and planted among the cinders being \\n\"examined\" by the agency that created them. He was abusing children \\n-- the tapes will be stored with the data on the JFK assassination. \\nHe set the fire -- our snipers saw him doing it. Film at 11 -- in \\n3000 A.D. He shot his followers who tried to escape -- or was that \\nJim Jones? Best of all, he\\'s dead -- he can\\'t say a damn thing to \\nembarrass us, any more than when his contact with the world was \\nsevered at the start of the whole travesty. \\n\\nA leading national paper claims 93% of the American people believe \\nthat a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow \\nresponsible for everything that resulted. But when did you ever \\nknow 93% of Americans to agree on anything -- doesn\\'t this sound \\nmore like the outcome of a Soviet election than an opinion poll? \\n\\nVery well, what can we infer from the above? For starters, never \\nforget that, although Democratic careers are on the line (and \\nrightfully so) over this fiasco, by the outlaw agency\\'s admission, \\nit was planned and rehearsed by a Republican administration. Which \\nmay explain why Paul Harvey, who evidently used up all his courage \\nand integrity changing his mind (at about the same time I did) \\nabout the war in Viet Nam -- has been acting as little more than a \\nmouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the Bill of Rights. \\n\\nMore importantly, when Rush Limbaugh, who\\'s been a quivering tower \\nof Jello during the whole thing, takes essentially the same stance \\nas Bill Clinton, it\\'s time for fundamental changes, if not in the \\nsystem, then at least within yourself. \\n\\nOn March 5, back at the beginning, Mary Gingell, national chair of \\nthe Libertarian Party, issued a press release condemning the outlaw \\nagency and calling for its abolition. In fact, the LP has promised \\nin its platform since 1977, for at least 16 years, to abolish both \\nagencies involved in Waco. I\\'m proud to say I was there and helped \\nto write that plank. \\n\\nTrue, the LP is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in \\n1977 -- ask the Democrats in Georgia if you doubt it). But, alone \\nin a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their \\nbehinds with phony polls and Big Lies, the LP is right about what \\nhappened in Waco. And if their advice had been followed in 1977, \\nWaco never would have happened. \\n\\nThink about it. And think about the fact that, if you\\'ve had enough \\nof political parties more interested in collecting and holding \\npower -- at whatever cost to the Bill of Rights, let alone human \\nlife -- than in defending and expanding individual liberty, maybe \\nthe change it\\'s time for within yourself is to make the LP less \\ntiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.\\n\\nThink about it.\\n\\nL.

This was the age of\\n  nationalism among the Christian subjects of the Sultan, starting with\\n  the Greek Revolution early in the nineteenth century, which, based on\\n  the Megali Idea, or Great Idea, sought to add to Greek kingdom Istanbul\\n  and large portions of Anatolia, union of which with Greece was felt to be\\n  the \\'dream and hope of all\\'. The success of the Greek national movement,\\n  provided more in fact by the intervention of the Great Powers than by the\\n  efforts of the Greeks themselves, stimulated similar uprisings among the\\n  other subjects in Southeastern Europe who had long been oppressed, not so\\n  much by the Ottomans but, rather, by the Greek religious hierarchy which\\n  dominated the Orthodox millet, leading first to pressure for religious\\n  independence, granted to the Bulgarian Orthodox Exarchate in 1870, to the\\n  Serbian Church in 1879, and to the Rumanian Church in 1885, with subsequent\\n  aspirations for, and achievement of, political independence following...>>\\n\\n  page 188:\\n\\n  <<...They [new nationalist leaders] were greatly assisted in their\\n   campaigns against the Ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular\\n   representatives of the major Powers of Europe and also by Christian\\n   missionaries, who emphasized feelings of Christian superiority and\\n   hatred for Muslims and Jews which fortified the religious as well as\\n   ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.\\n\\n   Christian nationalism, based as much on religious as on ethnic identity,\\n   soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both Jews\\n   and Muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.\\n   Vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic movements developed, involving\\n   large-scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies,\\n   by the independent states that resulted, also by Christian subjects\\n   who remained within the Empire, particularly because of Jewish and Muslim\\n   support for Ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent\\n   nationalist states of Southeastern Europe. The results were explosive\\n   and damaging.\\n\\n   The invading armies of Russia and Austria as well as the revolting\\n   nationalists and, later, successfully established independent Christian\\n   states, committed systematic genocide against Jews and Muslims throughout\\n   the nineteenth century, despite Great Power admonitions to the contrary\\n   in the treaties of Paris (1858) and Berlin (1878),...>>\\n\\n  page 188:\\n\\n  <<...As the peoples of Southeastern Europe achieved their independence,\\n   their Muslim and Jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and\\n   massacred, and those who survived were driven beyond the ever-shrinking\\n   boundaries of the retreating Ottoman Empire in a kind of slaughter which\\n   had not been seen since the dispersal of the Jews from Palestine centuries\\n   earlier.\\n\\n   This sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth\\n   century, with the Rumanian Principalities taking the lead, as united\\n   Rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth\\n   century. In 1579 the ruler of Moldavia, Peter the Lame, banished its\\n   Jews because of their competition with its Christian merchants. When\\n   Prince Micheal the Brave revolted against the Ottomans in the Rumanian\\n   principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia in 1593, he ordered the massacre\\n   of all the Jews as well as Turks in Bucharest.>>\\n\\n  page 189:\\n\\n  <<The slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. When the\\n  Greeks revolted against Ottoman rule many Greek volunteers coming from\\n  Russia and the Principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and\\n  plundered the Jewish communities along their paths as they went through\\n  Moldavia and Wallachia toward Greece.>>\\n\\n  page 190 (second paragraph):\\n\\n  <<When Venice occupied the island of Chios in 1694, its Jewish population\\n   was either massacred or deported and all Jewish communal and personal\\n   property was stolen by the native Greek population, leaving those Jews\\n   who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging, no longer able to\\n   compete with the Greeks in trade or commerce.>>\\n\\n  page 190 (third paragraph):\\n\\n  <<Jews living in Greece and the Rumanian principalities suffered terribly\\n   because of their support for Ottoman rule. When the Greek nationalist\\n   movement Philike Etairia started its uprising in Wallachia and Moldavia\\n   during the spring of 1821, hundreds of Jews and Muslims were killed by\\n   the Greeks who lived there as well as by native Wallachs [14]. During\\n   the height of the Greek revolution, five thousand Jews were massacred\\n   in Morea along with most of the Muslim population, numbering about\\n   twenty thousand in all [15]. In Tripolizza alone 1,200 Jews were\\n   massacred along with uncounted Turks [16].  Reverend John Hartley,\\n   after describing the carnage, concluded \\'Thus did Jewish blood, mingled\\n   with Turkish, flow down the streets of captured city. The sons of Isaac\\n   and the sons of Ishmael, on this as well as on every occasion during the\\n   Greek Revolution, met with common fate. Their corpses were cast out of the\\n   city, and, like the ancient sovereign of Judah, they received no burial\\n   superior to that of an ass.\\' [17] Jewish communities on the islands of\\n   Sparta, Patras, Corinthos, Mistra, and Argos were wiped out by bands of\\n   Greek rebels along with those of Thebes, Vrachori, Attica and Epirus [18].\\n   The surviving Jews fled to the island of Corfu, where Jews who had fled\\n   from Italy, and the Iberian Peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity\\n   under the Venetian rule since the twelfth century, though divided into\\n   rival Greek and Italian communities. It was not long, however, before\\n   it too fell victim to the Greek Revolution, leading to savage repression\\n   and massacres of Jews, forcing the surviving members of the two communities\\n   to come together for self-defense for the first time. Throughout the years\\n   of Greek revolution, Greek nationalists went from town to town on the\\n   mainland and from island to island in the Agean, exterminating all the\\n   Jews and Muslims they could find, many along the roads as they desperately\\n   fled to safety in what was left of the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary\\n   accounts relate that the Greeks left the murdered Jews and Muslims lying\\n   exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards [19]. Most of\\n   the Jews who survived these massacres fled across the Agean in small boats\\n   to Izmir, thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of Ottoman\\n   Jewish life during the nineteenth century. Only in Northern Greece,\\n   particularly in the areas of Janina and Salonica, were the Jews and the\\n   Turks able to successfully resist the Greek assaults, thus saving their\\n   populations from massacre as well [20]. During the remainder of the 19th\\n   century, particularly during the Greek-Turkish war in 1897, those Jews\\n   who remained in Greece in the areas of Athens, Chalkis, Larissa, Corfu\\n   and Crete suffered severe persecution and massacre, forcing thousands\\n   more to emigrate into Ottoman territory, particularly to Salonica and\\n   Izmir [21].>>\\n\\n   page 193 (last paragraph):\\n\\n   <<The inclusion in the Treaty of Berlin of stipulations providing\\n   protection for the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Southeastern Europe\\n   stimulated more popular anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hysteria in all\\n   the countries involved, with blood-libel accusations once again being\\n   used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging Jewish quarters as well as\\n   for new tactics for boycotting Jewish shopkeepers, merchants and\\n   professionals, a movement which was quickly adapted by the Christian\\n   millets in the major cities of the Ottoman Empire. Because the Bulgarians,\\n   Rumanians and Greeks correctly regarded the Jews as supporters of the\\n   Turks, both Jews and Turks were expelled from these countries in equally\\n   atrocious and brutal manners. Their property was plundered and their\\n   homes and shops taken over without compensation, while the survivors\\n   fled in desperation to Edirne and Istanbul. While official statements\\n   subsequently were issued granting equal rights to Jews, little was done\\n   in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the\\n   twentieth century.>>\\n\\n  page 194 (last paragraph):\\n\\n  <<Things were not much better elsewhere in Southeastern Europe or the\\n   Greek islands of the Agean and the eastern Mediterranean. In 1891 the\\n   Jews on Corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local Greeks due\\n   to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations [26]. Many of\\n   those who survived found refuge in Ottoman territory with the help of a\\n   popular subscription drive carried out in Istanbul under leadership of\\n   the Banque Camondo. In 1881 and 1884, and again in 1892 and 1903,\\n   thousands of Jews came to Ottoman territory as a result of pogroms\\n   in Russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods\\n   of respite. In 1899 Jewish families arrived in Istanbul in flight from\\n   persecution in Vidin, in independent Bulgaria.\\n\\n   The conquest of Ottoman Thrace and Macedonia by Greek and Bulgarian\\n   forces during the Balkan Wars (1912-13), including Salonica, Corlu,\\n   and Edirne, was followed by general attacks on Jews, their synagogues,\\n   homes and shops, in both countries [27], resulting in a renewed exodus\\n   toward Istanbul and beyond. Two reports from Salonica graphically\\n   described the situation caused by the invading armies:\\n\\n      \\'All the self-interested justifications of the newspapers of Europe,\\n      all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth, can never\\n      destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the\\n      entry of the Greeks in Salonica. A week of terror and horror one can\\n      never easily forget. The Hellenes now cruelly feel today all the\\n      damage that the explosion of hatred by the (Greek) population has done\\n      to their cause. The mob has shown itself odious and the government\\n      weak...The incompetence of the Greek administration and the horrors\\n      inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\\n\\n\\t2)  I\\'m not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \\nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\\nMark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally\\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don\\'t pactice the signs you aren\\'t\\n\"saved\".\\n\\n\\t3)  I know it\\'s hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\\nhas such diversity, but I think you\\'ve made some pretty big\\ngeneralizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a\\nsign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? \\nI\\'ve never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them\\nas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as\\na sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be\\ninclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,\\nthey do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be\\ncharismatic.\\n\\nKen Banner\\nDept. of Religious Studies\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\nkbanner@philae.sas.upenn.edu \\n',\n",
